== Description ==

Product Price History is the ultimate solution for WooCommerce shops aiming to establish transparency in their pricing strategy and gain the trust of their customers. This powerful plugin provides detailed price history charts and customizable lowest price messages, enabling you to stay competitive and showcase your unwavering commitment to transparency.

Moreover, showing customers the previous sale prices of a product empowers them to make informed decisions. With Product Price History, you not only meet the legal requirements but also assist your customers in making confident purchase choices.

By leveraging the capabilities of Product Price History, you can increase your profits, optimize your pricing strategy, and foster trust with your customers. They will genuinely appreciate the transparency and credibility it brings to your webshop.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= The price history chart is not displaying on my product pages, what should I do? =

First, enable the chart module, navigate to the "Price History > Chart Settings" section and ensure that the "Enable" option is checked. The "Minimum prices to display" field determines the minimum number of price changes required for the chart to be displayed.

It's important to note that the product price history only tracks price changes from the point at which the plugin was activated. It does not track any previous price changes that may have occurred before activation.

Ensure that the chart is not hidden on your product page, navigate to the "Product Price History" tab on the edit product page and make sure that the "Hide chart" checkbox is not checked.

If the chart still does not display, try clearing your browser cache or accessing the page from a different browser. If the issue persists, contact our support team for further assistance.

= What data does the plugin track? =

The plugin tracks the price of each product over time, including any sale prices or discounts.

= Can I customize the price history chart? =

Yes, the plugin provides a customizable chart with options to adjust the color scheme, minimum number of prices to show, and date range to display.

= Can I hide the chart on certain products only? =

Yes, you can do so by going to the edit product page, navigating to the "Product Price History" tab, and checking the "Hide chart" checkbox.

= Can I hide certain prices from the chart and/or lowest price display? =

Yes, you can do so by going to the edit product page. For simple products, navigate to the "Product Price History" tab and select the prices you would like to exclude.

For variable products, there are two sets of charts. The first chart displays prices before any variation is selected and can be found in the "Product Price History" tab on the edit product page. The second chart tracks prices for each variation and can be accessed by clicking on the variation and scrolling down to the bottom.

= Is displaying the lowest price mandatory? =

If you're operating in the European Union, displaying the lowest price of a product on sale within the last 30 days is mandatory. However, even if you're not required to do so, it's a best practice to show customers previous sale prices of a product.

= How does the plugin help me optimize my pricing strategy? =

By tracking your price history and displaying it in a chart, the plugin helps you to see which prices are most effective and make data-driven decisions about your pricing strategy.

= Will my customers appreciate the transparency provided by the plugin? =
